- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aakanksha6may <Aakanksha Kumari>
  An aspiring computer science engineering undergrad, and thinker.
  
  Highly analytical and detail-oriented professional with experience in data analysis and HR management. Skilled in data mining, statistical analysis, Python, Sql, and visualization. Adept at managing employee relations, recruitment, and talent management. Proven ability to develop and implement effective HR policies and procedures. Strong communication and interpersonal skills.

I love working on projects! What I love about my major is that the majority of my work, if not all of it, is completely team-oriented, which has allowed me to grow in my perspectives and development as an aspiring software engineer and entrepreneur. Hence, since attending my college, I have found immense interest in participating in hackathons at diverse universities. Though, Business administration , operations and human management will always be my personal favorite.

I have worked in more than 10 startups and after then founded my own startup @AAKANKSHA.Managing the startups, developing high quality business strategies and plans ensuring their alignment with short-term and long-term objectives, leading and motivating subordinates to advance employee engagement develop a high performing managerial team, overseeing all operations and business activities to ensure they produce the desired results and are consistent with the overall strategy and mission.
 The journey from school to college from joining free internship to paid internship from participating in hackathon to working for startups, attending live seminars, events, working for startups and then founding my own startup which I always wanted to do , this whole journey is learning period for me where I have seen myself learning and evolving each and everyday.
Working with so many startups in various roles has helped me build on my knowledge of the entire company, and how it operates. Having integrity, being loyal and trustworthy became even more important to me, as those are my personal core values as well. 

I’m interested in business administration, operations and human management, web and distributed systems, blockchain technology, Web development, android development , DBMS and robotics and then programming via C, Java, python. Outside of computer science, I love to dabble in cycling, football, video editing, logo design, writing, puzzles, graphic design and lately helping people maximizing their potentials, helping them in improving their communication skills, helping people from not hesitating and how to make a bold confident personality.

I loves to travel, partake in outdoor activities, and finding new adventure along the way. I have found that nothing satisfies me more than meeting new people, developing new relationships, solving problems, and contributing to the overall growth.
