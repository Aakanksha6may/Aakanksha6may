# 👋 Hello, I'm Aakanksha Sharma!  
🚀 **Python Developer | Backend Engineer | Tech Enthusiast | NLP & Data Science Learner | Ex-Founder | Research-Oriented**

I’m a passionate **Software Engineer** with a strong foundation in **Python, Backend Development, and Scalable Systems**.  
From launching startups to solving real-world problems with code, I enjoy working on everything from REST APIs to NLP pipelines.

## 🧠 My Tech Story  
I’ve built and scaled two tech ventures from scratch — leading cross-functional teams, developing full-stack applications, and delivering digital solutions to clients across domains.  
As an educator, I’ve trained over 10,000 students in programming, data science, and software development through industry-aligned, hands-on training.

A year of civil services preparation sharpened my analytical thinking and resilience — qualities I now bring into engineering meaningful, scalable software.

I combine backend development, data-driven systems, and research to solve real-world problems, with a focus on long-term impact and continuous innovation.
